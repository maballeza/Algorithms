## Overview
### Universities
Soon to be a generalized CSV parser capable of producing objects on which statistical analysis can be performed.
  > *Universities* currently parses data ranking top universities worldwide and optionally performs one form of analysis, printing either the results of the analysis or the parsed list of data.

#### To be continued...
- Additional analytical methods soon to be added.
- Implemention of template methods are in the works to remove dependence on class *University*
